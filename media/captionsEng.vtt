00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.880
I'm here at the Brigham Young Academy

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.640
Square.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.320
Here at Earthark Studios, we believe

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.320
that great design tells a story.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.600
This is the Beehive Fountain, which was

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.119
established all the way in 1914.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.359
I think it's a beautiful structure that

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.400
represents industry, and it's been here

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.920
for over a century.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.560
And when you look over here, you can

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.320
notice the 1891 inscription at the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.360
entrance. It's got strong bricks, arch

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.360
windows, all hallmarks of great enduring

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.360
design.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.879
And still, as we approach the entrance,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.000
you can see more strong vertical lines

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.600
and Romanesque arches. All of these

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.320
elements give the building its solid

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.480
foundation.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.800
And it's no wonder that it's lasted such

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.800
a long time.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.080
This building was designed with purpose

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.840
on a solid foundation. And that's what

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.840
we intend to do with every project that

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.840
we do here at Earth March Studios. Thank

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840
you.
